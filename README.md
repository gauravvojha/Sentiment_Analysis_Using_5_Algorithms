The script provided uses multiple sentiment analysis tools (VADER, RoBERTa, TextBlob, and Flair) to analyze a dataset of reviews. It evaluates the models by calculating precision, recall, and F1 scores for each sentiment category and visualizes the results.

# Observations:
Model-Specific Errors:
Errors like The expanded size of the tensor (571) must match the existing size (514) occur due to tokenization issues in RoBERTa. This happens when the input text exceeds the model's maximum token length (typically 512 tokens for RoBERTa).

# A solution is truncating long texts during tokenization:
python
encoded_text = tokenizer(example, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, max_length=512)

# Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores:
The metrics for some models and categories are 0.0000, indicating either model-specific issues or inadequate labeling of the dataset for evaluation.

# Performance Evaluation:
Results for VADER show strong precision for "Neutral" sentiment but poor performance for "Positive" and "Negative" categories. Similarly, other models have varying strengths and weaknesses.

# Suggested Improvements:
Error Handling for Tokenization:
Ensure all models process only valid input lengths by applying truncation as shown above.

# Data Preprocessing:
Clean text data, remove unwanted characters, and filter extremely short or lengthy reviews before analysis.

# Visualization:
Focus the pairplot on interpretable columns or aggregate metrics for clearer insights.

# Model Comparison:
Provide statistical summaries (e.g., mean F1 scores) to rank models by overall performance.

def polarity_scores_roberta(example):
    encoded_text = tokenizer(example, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, max_length=512)
    output = model(**encoded_text)
    scores = output[0][0].detach().numpy()
    scores = softmax(scores)
    scores_dict = {
        'roberta_neg': scores[0],
        'roberta_neu': scores[1],
        'roberta_pos': scores[2]
    }
    return scores_dict
    
# Final Steps:
Rerun the analysis after implementing these fixes to ensure no data is dropped due to tokenization errors.
Share visualizations and metrics to compare the models effectively.
